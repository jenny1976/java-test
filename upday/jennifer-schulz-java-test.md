## Part 1: Writing

> 1) What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but we’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

I've got one personal web-project that i'm very proud of. It's simply my own webblog with a lot of stories, pictures and of course also 
some nonsense, but i love it because it's full of great thing to remember out of the last 10 years. Also my familiy and friends that aren't living in 
berlin, like to come by and check the news :) For me it's also fun the check some old holiday stories from time to time.
  
> 2) Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it as well.

Recently i found an interesting article on heise.de about APIs-Design. It was an interview with Kacper Nowicki who is a software architect and engineer with over 20 years of experience.
He came from Google Poland where he built the developer team for 8 years. Since the beginning of 2015 he is CTO at goeuro.de . 
A lot of things he said were just so true and reminded me of some situations i experienced at work. From my point of view the most important rule he mentions 
is keeping an eye on code quality from the start. It might take longer while developing but saves a lot of time afterwards when you have to do a bugfix, implement new features or need to introduce new colleagues to the code. If you haven't read it, see here:
